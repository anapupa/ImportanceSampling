# Fast Importance Sampling(Toy Repository)
This repository is based on the draft code from [Fast Hierarchical Importance Sampling with Blue Noise Properties](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~ostrom/ImportanceSampling/).

And we make some extension based on it.

- Speed-up the cache by using morton-code for image storage.
- Hilbert-curve path sampling(O(n) Fast Algorithm over arbitrary samples without blue noise property guarantee).
